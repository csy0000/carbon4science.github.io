# Protein Folding

**Task description:** Protein structure prediction from amino-acid sequence.

## Goal

Compare structure-prediction accuracy against runtime, energy use, and CO2 emissions for locally runnable folding backends from `Protein-Folding-Benchmark`.

The current Carbon4Science export is the **45-target CASP15/CASP16 unique `<1000` residue benchmark** built from three combined benchmark runs:

```text
/home/chen/projects/Protein-Folding-Benchmark/results/2026-06-09-combine-8models-gpu
```

It contains **360 scored protein/model rows: 45 targets × 8 scored models**. The scored models are `af2`, `colabfold`, `openfold`, `protenix`, `chai1`, `esmfold`, `omegafold`, and `boltz2`. All 45 targets are successfully predicted and scored for every model. `chai1`, `esmfold`, and `boltz2` were re-run on GPU (2026-06-09) to make all eight models GPU-measured; the other five models are unchanged from the original runs.

## Dataset

- **Dataset name:** CASP15/CASP16 unique PDB-chain target set, residue count `<1000`.
- **N:** 45 targets (common across all three combined runs).
- **Source target CSV:** `data/targets/targets_casp15_casp16_unique_lt1000_prepared.csv` in `Protein-Folding-Benchmark`.
- **Exported dataset CSV:** `results/benchmark-dataset.csv`.
- **Export manifest:** `results/benchmark_collection_manifest.csv`.
- **References:** Per-target reference PDBs are extracted from cached mmCIF files using the manifest's explicit `chain_id` and `residue_start`/`residue_end` range. Reference paths are recorded in `results/benchmark_scores_all_models.csv` and each model's JSON file.

AlphaFold2 is reported as the official `af2` backend using DeepMind AlphaFold2 source, official parameters, full AlphaFold database search, and split MSA/features versus JAX inference carbon accounting. ColabFold remains reported separately as ColabFold, not relabeled as AF2.

## Benchmark Protocol

The source benchmark repo is `/home/chen/projects/Protein-Folding-Benchmark`. Each backend uses the standard runner interface:

```bash
bash runners/run_MODEL.sh input.fasta output_dir top_k
```

Each runner writes standardized predictions as `rank_001.pdb`, `rank_002.pdb`, and so on, plus `metadata.json`. This export uses `top_k=1` for compact, comparable carbon accounting.

Scoring reports:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| `lddt_ca` | lDDT over C-alpha atoms; primary ranking metric. |
| `tmalign_tm_score_ref` | TM-score normalized by reference length from USalign/TM-align. |
| `ca_rmsd` | C-alpha RMSD after sequential alignment. |
| `GDT_TS` / `gdt_ts` | Global Distance Test - Total Score on a 0–1 scale. |
| `GDT_TS_percent` / `gdt_ts_percent` | Global Distance Test - Total Score on a 0–100 scale. |
| `inference_time_sec` | Controller wall-clock runtime per target/model. |
| `carbon_emissions_g` | CodeCarbon offline emissions in grams CO2e. |
| `carbon_energy_consumed_kwh` | CodeCarbon energy consumption in kWh. |

`GDT_TS` is the visible alias used in the exported Carbon4Science CSVs; the lowercase `gdt_ts` column is retained for compatibility with the benchmark scripts. Scoring uses `--match-mode sequence` (Needleman-Wunsch Cα alignment against per-target reference PDBs).

## Models

| Model | Mode / MSA in current export | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `af2` | MSA; `official_af2_database_search` | official DeepMind AlphaFold2 database search; split MSA/features and JAX inference carbon accounting |
| `colabfold` | MSA; `shared_precomputed_msa` | reuses precomputed ColabFold/MMseqs2 A3M metadata from the benchmark run |
| `openfold` | MSA; `shared_precomputed_msa` | loads AlphaFold2 `params_model_1` weights through the OpenFold inference engine (weights byte-identical to `af2`; see Training-data cutoffs) |
| `protenix` | MSA; `shared_precomputed_msa` | ByteDance AF3-like diffusion model; reuses ColabFold/MMseqs2 A3M |
| `chai1` | no MSA; `native_embedding_no_msa` | default Chai-1 embeddings without external MSAs/templates |
| `esmfold` | no MSA; `native_single_sequence` | sequence-language-model baseline |
| `omegafold` | no MSA; `native_single_sequence` | sequence-only baseline |
| `boltz2` | MSA; `shared_precomputed_msa` | reuses precomputed ColabFold/MMseqs2 A3M; charged the shared MSA-build cost like openfold/protenix |

## Training-data cutoffs

Training-run timestamps are not embedded in any checkpoint. The benchmark-relevant date is the **PDB release-date cutoff** used when building each model's training set — the newest structure the model was allowed to see, which determines potential leakage into the CASP15/16 target set.

| Model | PDB cutoff | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| af2 | 2018-04-30 | Confirmed | [Jumper et al. 2021 suppl.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) (CASP13-aligned monomer training cutoff) |
| colabfold | 2018-04-30 | Confirmed | inherits AF2 `alphafold2_ptm` weights → same cutoff |
| openfold | 2018-04-30 | Confirmed | **this benchmark** runs AF2 `params_model_1` weights via the OpenFold engine; not OpenFold's own retrained (Dec-2021) checkpoint |
| esmfold | 2020-05-01 | Confirmed | folding-head PDB cutoff; [Lin et al. 2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574) |
| chai1 | 2021-01-12 | Confirmed | [Chai-1 technical report](https://chaiassets.com/chai-1/paper/technical_report_v1.pdf) |
| protenix | 2021-09-30 | Confirmed | `protenix_base_default_v1.0.0` follows AF3 training cutoff; [Protenix README](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix/blob/main/README.md) |
| boltz2 | 2023-06-01 | Confirmed | [Passaro et al. 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.14.659707v1.full): "every PDB structure up to 06/01/2023" |
| omegafold | not documented | Unconfirmed | no explicit PDB date published by the authors; [~2022 inferred from release](https://github.com/HeliXonProtein/OmegaFold/issues/13) |

Our 45-target set contains **33 CASP15 targets (2022)** and **12 CASP16 targets (2024)**. All cutoffs predate CASP16. Only **Boltz-2 (cutoff 2023-06-01)** postdates CASP15, meaning its 33 CASP15-target results should be interpreted with a potential training-data leakage caveat. All other models predated CASP15.

## Current Results

Source summary: `results/benchmark_model_summary_all_models.csv`. Per-replicate values and across-replicate statistics: the `replicates`, `aggregate_summary_across_reps` and `cost_totals_across_reps` blocks in each `results/{model}.json`.

**Dataset:** CASP15/CASP16 unique <1000-residue monomers · **N =** 45 targets · **Replicates:** n = 3 · **Metric:** lDDT-Cα (primary) · **CO₂/job:** per target (exp = 45 targets)

**Bold** = best value in column (for Cα-RMSD, lower is better). GDT_TS is shown on a 0–100 scale (`gdt_ts_percent`). CO₂/exp and Time/exp are totals over all 45 targets; per-job columns divide by 45. For the four shared-MSA models (colabfold, openfold, protenix, boltz2) the total includes the shared ColabFold/MMseqs2 MSA-build cost; each model is charged the same per-target build time even though the MSA is computed once, so these totals compare models to each other but are **not additive across models**. Counting the shared MSA once, a whole replicate costs **16.5 ± 0.27 h**.

**colabfold and openfold are not separable in this benchmark.** colabfold leads on lDDT-Cα by 0.0007, which is smaller than openfold's own across-replicate std of 0.0018; they tie on TM-score to four decimals, and openfold leads on GDT_TS. Treat the top two as a tie rather than a ranking.

**Only two of the eight models are deterministic.** esmfold and omegafold reproduce exactly across replicates (0.000000 spread on all 45 targets). At the per-target level, 152 of the 315 non-af2 (target, model) pairs exceed a 1e-3 lDDT-Cα tolerance — largest spreads boltz2 0.105, openfold 0.089, chai1 0.082, protenix 0.062, colabfold 0.0055. chai1 uses no MSA, so its spread cannot come from MSA rebuilding; that isolates genuine sampling nondeterminism in the diffusion-based models. Per-target variation nevertheless averages out at the benchmark level, where every across-replicate std is ≤ 0.0034 lDDT-Cα.

† **af2's cost is a composite, not a mean.** Replicates 2 and 3 reuse replicate 1's MSA features (`features.pkl`), which saves ~20 h each. af2's MSA build is therefore measured once — 19.83 h and 1,873 g CO₂, the single largest cost item in the benchmark, exceeding an entire replicate's incremental cost — while only af2 *inference* (1.75 ± 0.04 h) has an error bar. The MSA stage is deterministic given fixed databases, so this limits the cost error bar, not accuracy.

**Energy and CO₂ error bars are inflated by replicate 1.** Replicates 2 and 3 agree to within ~1% on energy, while replicate 1 is a systematic outlier in both directions by model group (~30–58% higher for the shared-MSA consumers, 14–20% lower for the MSA-free ones) even where runtime is nearly identical. This looks like a measurement or attribution difference in that run rather than run-to-run variance. The runtime columns are unaffected.

**GDT_TS changed method in this export.** Values now come from `external_tmscore_matched` (TMscore binary on sequence-matched Cα atoms) rather than the earlier `internal_iterative_ca`, so they are not comparable with GDT_TS figures published before 2026-08-04. lDDT-Cα, TM-score and Cα-RMSD are unaffected.

Parameter counts were measured directly from the local model weights: JAX `.npz` array sizes (summed `arr.size`) for the AF2-family models (af2, colabfold, openfold reuse the same Evoformer weights at 93.2M each); summed `tensor.numel()` over PyTorch/TorchScript checkpoint weights containers for the remaining models. `(+2.84B ESM2)` denotes the separate ESM-2 3B language model (`esm2_t36_3B_UR50D`) that `chai1` and `esmfold` load as a sequence embedder at inference; the folding-trunk parameters are listed first.

## MSA Cross-Mode Variants (2026-07-09)

The main export above runs each model in its default MSA mode. This follow-up
experiment runs four of them in the **opposite** MSA mode on the **same 45
targets**, to isolate the effect of the MSA alone. Each variant is a distinct
model label; the eight-model table above is unchanged.

- **Source run:** `results/20260709_casp15_casp16_unique_lt1000_msa-variants` (in `Protein-Folding-Benchmark`).
- **MSA source:** for `chai1_msa`, the shared ColabFold/MMseqs2 A3M already computed for the CASP targets, converted to Chai-1's `.aligned.pqt` format. The three `*_nomsa` variants use no MSA (single-sequence input).
- **Exported JSONs:** `results/chai1_msa.json`, `results/boltz2_nomsa.json`, `results/colabfold_nomsa.json`, `results/openfold_nomsa.json`. All 45/45 targets predicted (GPU) and scored with the same `--match-mode sequence` protocol.

| Variant | Mode vs default | lDDT-Cα | TM-score | GDT_TS (%) | Cα-RMSD (Å) | CO₂/job (g) | Time/job (s) | Δ lDDT-Cα (vs base) |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| chai1_msa       | **+**ColabFold MSA (default: none) | 0.562   | 0.533    | 43.89      | 24.996      | 3.29        | 141          | **−0.236** (chai1 0.798) |
| boltz2_nomsa    | **−**MSA, single-sequence (default: MSA) | 0.421   | 0.387    | 27.12      | 29.835      | 1.31        | 67           | −0.442 (boltz2 0.863) |
| colabfold_nomsa | **−**MSA, single-sequence (default: MSA) | 0.307   | 0.290    | 16.89      | 32.431      | 2.07        | 128          | −0.569 (colabfold 0.876) |
| openfold_nomsa  | **−**MSA, single-sequence (default: MSA) | 0.307   | 0.288    | 16.92      | 32.839      | 1.92        | 70           | −0.568 (openfold 0.875) |

All 45/45 targets scored for every variant (mean **284 aligned Cα** per target, range 70–632; identical across variants since they share the target sequences). **GDT_TS** is on a 0–100 scale and is computed with the TMscore binary on the sequence-matched Cα atoms (`external_tmscore_matched`); for Cα-RMSD lower is better. **CO₂/job** is CodeCarbon world-average emissions per target (`total_carbon_with_shared_msa_g`) and **Time/job** is wall-clock per target — the three `*_nomsa` variants build no MSA, and `chai1_msa` reuses the shared ColabFold MSA and is not re-charged its build cost, so its carbon is inference-only. Per-protein scores, carbon, and runtime are in `results/benchmark-score.csv`, `results/benchmark_scores_all_models.csv`, and `results/benchmark_model_summary_all_models.csv` alongside the eight base models, and in each variant's JSON.

**Removing the MSA (rows 2–4)** collapses the three MSA-dependent models, as
expected: ColabFold and OpenFold both run AlphaFold2 Evoformer weights, which
lose almost all accuracy without an alignment (lDDT-Cα ≈ 0.31), and the Boltz-2
diffusion trunk drops from 0.863 to 0.421. These confirm how much of each
model's accuracy is carried by the MSA.

**Adding the MSA to Chai-1 (row 1) is the notable result: it makes Chai-1 worse
on average** (0.562 vs 0.798 single-sequence). The effect is strongly bimodal —
the MSA *improves* 10/45 targets (e.g. T1145 +0.32, T1159 +0.30) but *degrades*
22/45, several to near-unfolded structures (T1185s2 −0.72, T1185s4 −0.68,
T1272s4 −0.67), concentrated on the multi-domain CASP subdomain targets
(T1137sX / T1272sX / T1114sX / T1185sX).

This is **genuine Chai-1 behavior, not an artifact of our ColabFold A3M.** We
verified it by re-folding all 45 targets with Chai-1's *own* online MSA server
(properly per-database source-tagged and species-paired): the native-MSA mean is
**0.563 vs our ColabFold-A3M 0.562** (mean |Δ| = 0.005, max 0.025 lDDT-Cα per
target), collapsing on the same targets. So `chai1_msa` reflects the model, not
our MSA pipeline. It is consistent with reported "MSA can hurt AF3-style models"
behavior — Chai-1's maintainers acknowledge predictions can be worse with MSAs
that are "not consistent with the model's expectations"
([chai-lab discussion #277](https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab/discussions/277)),
and a related effect is reported for Boltz
([issue #627](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz/issues/627)) — though those
reports concern irrelevant MSAs on designed/orphan proteins, whereas here the
degradation is on natural targets with deep, relevant alignments.

## Exported Files

The `results/` directory is intentionally clean and contains the latest export:

- `results/benchmark-dataset.csv` — the 45-target benchmark dataset: target IDs, sequences, reference PDB paths, and CASP notes.
- `results/benchmark-score.csv` — compact per-protein/model score, GDT_TS, runtime, and carbon rows.
- `results/benchmark_scores_all_models.csv` — detailed per-protein/model score rows, including references and prediction paths.
- `results/benchmark-metadata.csv` — per-protein/model runtime, carbon, MSA, and provenance rows.
- `results/benchmark_metadata_all_models.csv` — same metadata table retained for compatibility with prior exports.
- `results/benchmark_model_summary_all_models.csv` — one summary row per exported model.
- `results/benchmark_collection_manifest.csv` — source result directory, target set, scored row counts, JSON file count, and GDT_TS scale notes.
- `results/score_metric_definitions.csv` and `results/score_metric_definitions.md` — score metric definitions.
- `results/af2.json`
- `results/colabfold.json`
- `results/openfold.json`
- `results/protenix.json`
- `results/chai1.json`
- `results/esmfold.json`
- `results/omegafold.json`
- `results/boltz2.json`

Each of the eight model JSONs above carries, in addition to the single-run blocks (`aggregate_summary`, `per_protein_scores`, `per_prediction_scores`, `per_protein_runtime_metadata`, `per_protein_status`):

- `n_replicates` and `primary_replicate` — how many replicates the file covers, and which one the per-protein blocks come from (`rep1`).
- `replicates[]` — one entry per replicate with its `source_result_dir`, full `aggregate_summary`, and `cost_totals` (runtime, MSA-build, energy, CO₂).
- `aggregate_summary_across_reps` and `cost_totals_across_reps` — per metric, `{mean, std, n_reps, values}`, where `std` is the sample standard deviation (ddof = 1) and `values` keeps the three individual replicate numbers.

The four MSA cross-mode variant JSONs below are from a single run and carry no replicate blocks.

MSA cross-mode variants (see the section above; separate 2026-07-09 run):

- `results/chai1_msa.json`

The 45-target benchmark is assembled from five source runs (three original GPU runs plus two GPU reruns for the three CPU-executed models) and scored with the combined-run scripts. From the `Protein-Folding-Benchmark` repo root:

**1. Combine predictions from the five source runs:**
```bash
conda run -n folding-benchmark python scripts/combine_8model_predictions.py \
  --dest results/2026-06-09-combine-8models-gpu
```

**2. Build per-target reference PDBs (correct chain + residue range from manifest):**
```bash
conda run -n folding-benchmark python scripts/build_combined_references.py \
  --run-dir results/2026-06-09-combine-8models-gpu
```

**3. Score all 45 targets × 8 models:**
```bash
conda run -n folding-benchmark python scripts/score_combined_8models.py \
  --run-dir results/2026-06-09-combine-8models-gpu \
  --match-mode sequence
```

**4. Export to carbon4science format:**
```bash
conda run -n folding-benchmark python scripts/export_combined_to_carbon4science.py \
  --run-dir results/2026-06-09-combine-8models-gpu \
  --out-dir ../carbon4science.github.io/results
```

## Limitations

- This is a 45-target local benchmark, not the full CASP15/CASP16 benchmark universe.
- Model outputs are local-run artifacts from one workstation and should be interpreted with that hardware and software context.
- Carbon estimates use CodeCarbon offline world-average accounting, not direct facility metering.
- References are extracted per-target from mmCIF files using the manifest's `chain_id` and `residue_start`/`residue_end`; results are not directly comparable to benchmarks using different reference extraction strategies.
- Training-data cutoffs are documented in the `## Training-data cutoffs` section. Boltz-2 (cutoff 2023-06-01) postdates the CASP15 targets (33/45) and may have trained on structures overlapping that target set. OmegaFold's cutoff is not publicly documented.
